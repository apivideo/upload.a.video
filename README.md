<h1 align="center">api.video upload a video</h1>

[api.video](https://api.video) is the video infrastructure for product builders. Lightning fast video APIs for integrating, scaling, and managing on-demand & low latency live streaming features in your app.

## Upload a video

[upload.a.video](https://upload.a.video) uses a [upload token](https://docs.api.video/reference/post_upload-tokens) and the [TypeScript video uploader](https://docs.api.video/docs/video-uploader) to upload a video into your account. To make this standalone html to work with your api.video account, you'll need an upload token and the value inserted into the URL paramater on line 236 of index.html.
